Free the Bubble!

This is a 2D game made in the Godot Game Engine with GDScript. It is adapted from my completed version of the YouTube tutorial by Brackey on a 2D Godot game. This game is a work in progress, but will see the main
character heroicly defeat a tyrannical ruler and free the power of the Celestial Bubble.
